			<h4>It Can Be Frustrating To Learn How To Code!</h4>
			<p>If you're someone like me, who has dyslexia, learning how to code a website or a new app can be very frustrating sometimes. The best advice I can offer is to just keep on pushing through. Use the support resources at your disposal to help you get through the learning process. That is, after all, what they're there for.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Don't throw your computer against a wall.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
